This directory includes the patches applied to WP core ("core hacks"). 
These patches must be applied always when the WP version is updated, because
the upgrade process replaces all the files in wp-include, wp-admin and
wp-content.

Please document below what each patch does.

  ms-settings_201301082151.patch
--------------------------------
WP multisite configuration doesn't allow running WP on different port than
80 or 443. This patch fixes the problem.

The patch wasn't yet included in WP 3.8.1, and we apply it manually.
