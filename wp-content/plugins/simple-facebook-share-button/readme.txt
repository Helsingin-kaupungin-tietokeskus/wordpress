== Description ==

On July 17, 2012, Facebook completely dropped support for the Share button, rendering this plugin useless. It is no longer supported and should be deleted.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happened to this plugin? =

Soon after Facebook launched its Like button in April 2010, it announced that the Share button was no longer the preferred way of sharing content to Facebook (they deprecated the service). The button was, until July 17, 2012, still supported though.

As of July 17, 2012, the button no longer functions, so I removed all of its functionality and will no longer support it.

If you're looking for a Like button alternative, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search.php?q=facebook+like">search for &quot;Facebook Like&quot;</a> in the plugins repository.
