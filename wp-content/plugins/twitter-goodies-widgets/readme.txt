Uses the twitter goodies widgets API to create offical twitter widgets (profiles, lists, faves and search) straight from your control panel. Same options as on twitter.com

== Description ==

This plugin will allow you to create any one of the four Twitter widgets located at twitter's website [twitter.com/goodies/widgets](twitter.com/goodies/widgets) with the friendly wordpress drag & drop convenience of widgets. Some of the features:

* Can create multiple twitter widget instnaces (uses the new WP widget API)
* Four for one! Four twitter widgets - twitter lists, faves, your twitter profile, or a search
* All the options available via the twitter widget page are available here too (as of Nov 05 2009).
* Save multiple themes for your twitter widget. Use one theme (or many) across multiple widgets, no need to retype settings like on the twitter site.
* Quickly and easly switch between the different twitter widget types.
* One widget makes for twitter widgets.
* Place widgets in your posts and pages too with shortcodes (see notes).

To generate a twitter widget in your pages, here is a shortcode with all the attributes:

[tgw title="Title for twitter widget" subject="Caption for twitter widget" username="Twitter User Name" search="Twitter search string" type="Either (search|list|faves|profile)" list="Twitter List Name"]

Look at one of the twitter widget options in your admin panel, or also on the twitter site [twitter.com/goodies/widgets](twitter.com/goodies/widgets) to see what combination you need for which widget type.
